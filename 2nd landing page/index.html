          Supply chain management (SCM) is the centralized management of the flow of goods and services and includes all
          processes that transform raw materials into final products.
          By managing the entire production flow of a good or service — starting from the raw components all the way to
          delivering the final product to the consumer — companies can create a network of suppliers.

          Curative care represents a proactive approach to medical treatment. This care aims to eliminate medical
          issues, rather than simply minimizing their impact.
          A patient that is receiving curative care will typically receive medication, have access to technology,
          undergo surgery, and take any other measures that could be considered effective approaches to treat an
          illness.
